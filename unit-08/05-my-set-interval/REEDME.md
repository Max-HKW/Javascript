# Delayed Logging with setTimeout

## Overview
This document explains how to simulate the behavior of `setInterval` using `setTimeout`. The code logs "Hello!" to the console every 2 seconds until a counter reaches 15, at which point the logging stops.

### 1. **File Description**
The file contains a function that logs a message ("Hello!") to the console every 2 seconds. It uses `setTimeout` to simulate the behavior of `setInterval`, and stops the process automatically once the counter reaches 15. No manual cleanup is needed, as the process halts after the specified iterations.

### 2. **Function Explanations**

#### a) **`mySetTimeout`**
This function is the core of the process. It:
- Logs "Hello!" to the console.
- Increments a counter each time it is called.
- Calls itself recursively with a 2-second delay using `setTimeout`.
- Stops when the counter reaches 15 (it no longer calls itself after the 15th iteration).

- **Parameters**: No parameters.
- **Returns**: This function does not return any value; it simply performs an action (logs to the console).

#### b) **`counter`**
The `counter` variable keeps track of how many times "Hello!" has been logged to the console. Once it reaches 15, the recursive calls to `setTimeout` stop.

- **Purpose**: Track the number of iterations to limit the logging process.

#### c) **How it Works**
- **Step 1**: The function `mySetTimeout` is called initially, and it logs "Hello!".
- **Step 2**: After 2 seconds, `setTimeout` is called again, and `mySetTimeout` is executed again.
- **Step 3**: This continues until the counter reaches 15, at which point the condition `if (counter < 15)` fails, and no further recursive calls are made.
- **Step 4**: Once the counter hits 15, the logging stops, and the process ends automatically.

### 3. **Why `setTimeout` and Not `setInterval`?**
- **`setTimeout`** is used here to simulate the behavior of `setInterval`. While `setInterval` calls a function repeatedly at specified intervals, `setTimeout` is typically used for a single delay. By calling `setTimeout` recursively, we can control the delay between each execution and stop the recursive calls after a certain condition is met (in this case, after 15 iterations).
  
### 4. **Benefits and Limitations**
- **Benefits**:
  - Simple and easy to understand.
  - Simulates repeated execution without using `setInterval`.
  - Automatically stops once the condition is met, no need for manual cleanup.
- **Limitations**:
  - The use of `setTimeout` for recursive calls can be less efficient if there's a long-running or highly frequent process.
  - For more complex scenarios, managing multiple timeouts manually could become difficult.

### 5. **Conclusion**
This solution demonstrates how to simulate repeated execution at fixed intervals using `setTimeout`, without relying on `setInterval`. The logging process stops automatically after 15 iterations, making the code self-contained and easy to understand.
