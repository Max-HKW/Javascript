# Delayed Calculator: Performing Basic Operations with a 3-Second Delay

## Introduction
This document explains how to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with a **3-second delay** between each operation, using JavaScript's `Promise` and `async/await`. Each operation will wait for the previous one to finish before starting the next.

## Process Explanation

### 1. **Creating a Promise**
The main operation is wrapped in a **Promise**. A Promise is used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks. When the operation starts, it doesn't return a result immediately. Instead, it returns a Promise that will eventually be resolved with the result of the operation. The Promise can be in three states:
- **Pending**: The operation is still in progress.
- **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully.
- **Rejected**: There was an error during the operation.

In this case, the Promise will eventually be **fulfilled** with the result of the operation (e.g., the sum of two numbers).

### 2. **Delaying the Operation**
Inside the Promise, the operation is delayed by **3 seconds** using the `setTimeout` function. This simulates the asynchronous nature of the operation. While the operation is delayed, the function doesnâ€™t return the result immediately. It waits for 3 seconds before executing the operation and resolving the Promise with the result.

### 3. **Performing the Arithmetic Operations**
Once the delay is completed, the function performs one of the four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. It checks the type of operation requested and executes the corresponding mathematical operation using the provided operands. If the operation is valid, the result is calculated; otherwise, an error message is returned (for example, division by zero).

### 4. **Returning the Result**
After calculating the result, the function resolves the Promise with the calculated result. This means that the result is now available to be used or logged by other parts of the program. This ensures that the result is only returned after the delay and after the operation is completed.

### 5. **Sequential Execution with `async`/`await`**
To execute the operations in sequence (one after another), the `async`/`await` syntax is used. The `async` keyword defines a function as asynchronous, allowing it to use the `await` keyword. `await` pauses the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved. This ensures that the next operation doesn't start until the previous one is completed, including the 3-second delay between each.

### 6. **Handling Multiple Operations**
The operations are executed sequentially by calling the delayed function for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The program waits for the Promise to resolve for each operation before moving on to the next one. This creates a clean, predictable flow of operations with a 3-second delay between each.

### Example Flow
- The first operation (addition) is performed, and the result is logged after 3 seconds.
- The second operation (subtraction) follows, with another 3-second delay.
- The same process repeats for multiplication and division.

### Benefits of Using `Promise` and `async/await`
- **Readability**: Using `Promise` and `async/await` makes the code easier to read and understand compared to using traditional callback functions or nested promises.
- **Sequential Execution**: `async/await` ensures that operations are executed one at a time, and the program doesn't proceed to the next operation until the current one is completed.
- **Asynchronous Behavior**: By using `Promise`, the operations don't block the program from doing other tasks during the delay, making the program more efficient for concurrent operations.

### Summary
In this approach:
- **Promises** are used to handle the asynchronous nature of the delayed operations.
- **setTimeout** simulates the delay between each operation.
- **async/await** ensures that each operation waits for the previous one to finish before starting.

This allows for clear and manageable code while performing basic arithmetic operations with a delay, ensuring that each operation happens in sequence and the result is logged after the delay.
