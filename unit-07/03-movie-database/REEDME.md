## Description  
This JavaScript file defines an array of movie objects and logs their details.  
Each movie includes:  
- A `title` (string) representing the movie's name.  
- A `duration` (number) representing the duration of the movie in minutes.  
- A `stars` (array of strings) listing the main actors in the movie.  

The script demonstrates the use of **objects, arrays, iteration, and string formatting** in JavaScript.

## Features  
- Defines a `Movie` object type.  
- Stores multiple movies in an array.  
- Uses `console.log()` to display structured movie information.  
- Implements iteration using `forEach()` for easy and readable output.  
- Uses `.join(', ')` to format the list of actors properly.

## Examples of Console Logs
