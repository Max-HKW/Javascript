## Description  
This JavaScript file defines an array of recipe objects and logs each recipe's details to the browser console.  
Each recipe includes:
- A `title` (string) representing the recipe name.
- A `servings` (number) indicating the number of servings.
- An `ingredients` (array of strings) listing the required ingredients.

The script demonstrates the use of **objects, arrays, and iteration** in JavaScript.

## Features  
- Defines a `Recipe` object type.  
- Stores multiple recipes in an array.  
- Uses `console.log()` to display structured recipe information.  
- Implements iteration using `forEach()` for a cleaner and more readable output.

## Examples of Console Logs
