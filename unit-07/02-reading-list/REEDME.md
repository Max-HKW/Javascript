# main.js

## Author  
[Il tuo Nome]

## Description  
This JavaScript file defines an array of book objects and logs whether each book has been read or not.  
Each book includes:
- A `title` (string) representing the book's name.
- An `author` (string) representing the author's name.
- An `alreadyRead` (boolean) indicating if the book has been read.

The script demonstrates the use of **objects, arrays, conditional statements, and iteration** in JavaScript.

## Features  
- Defines a `Book` object type.  
- Stores multiple books in an array.  
- Uses `console.log()` to display structured book information.  
- Implements iteration using `forEach()` for a cleaner and more readable output.  
- Uses an `if/else` statement to change the output based on whether the book has been read.

## Examples of Console Logs  

### Example 1: Book Already Read  
```sh
You already read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien
